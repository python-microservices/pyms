# Welcome to PyMS

PyMS, Python MicroService, is a collection of libraries, best practices and recommended ways to build 
microservices with Python.

## Motivation

When we started to create microservice with no idea, we were looking for tutorials, guides, best practices, but we found
nothing to create professional projects. Most articles say:
- "Install flask"
- "Create routes"
- (Sometimes) "Create a swagger specs"
- "TA-DA! you have a microservice"

But... what happens with our configuration out of code like Kubernetes configmap? what happens with transactionality? 
If we have many microservices, what happens with traces?.

There are many problems around Python and microservices and we can`t find anyone to give a solution.

We start creating these projects to try to solve all the problems we have found in our professional lives about 
microservices architecture.

Nowadays, is not perfect and we have a looong roadmap, but we hope this library could help other felas and friends ;)

PyMS, Python MicroService, is a [Microservice chassis pattern](https://microservices.io/patterns/microservice-chassis.html)
like Spring Boot (Java) or Gizmo (Golang). PyMS is a collection of libraries, best practices and recommended ways to build
microservices with Python which handles cross-cutting concerns:

- Externalized configuration
- Logging
- Health checks
- Metrics
- Distributed tracing

PyMS is powered by [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/), [Connexion](https://github.com/zalando/connexion)
and [Opentracing](https://opentracing.io/).

Get started with [Installation](./docs/installation.md) and then get an overview with the [Quickstart](./docs/quickstart.md).

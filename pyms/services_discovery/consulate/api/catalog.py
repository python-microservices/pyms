        """A a low level mechanism for directly registering or updating
        entries in the catalog. It is usually recommended to use the agent
        local endpoints, as they are simpler and perform anti-entropy.

        The behavior of the endpoint depends on what keys are provided. The
        endpoint requires Node and Address to be provided, while Datacenter
        will be defaulted to match that of the agent. If only those are
        provided, the endpoint will register the node with the catalog.

        If the Service key is provided, then the service will also be
        registered. If ID is not provided, it will be defaulted to Service.
        It is mandated that the ID be node-unique. Both Tags and Port can
        be omitted.

        If the Check key is provided, then a health check will also be
        registered. It is important to remember that this register API is
        very low level. This manipulates the health check entry, but does
        not setup a script or TTL to actually update the status. For that
        behavior, an agent local check should be setup.

        The CheckID can be omitted, and will default to the Name. Like
        before, the CheckID must be node-unique. The Notes is an opaque
        field that is meant to hold human readable text. If a ServiceID is
        provided that matches the ID of a service on that node, then the
        check is treated as a service level health check, instead of a node
        level health check. Lastly, the status must be one of "unknown",
        "passing", "warning", or "critical". The "unknown" status is used to
        indicate that the initial check has not been performed yet.

        It is important to note that Check does not have to be provided
        with Service and visa-versa. They can be provided or omitted at will.

        Example service dict:

        .. code:: python

            'Service': {
                'ID': 'redis1',
                'Service': 'redis',
                'Tags': ['master', 'v1'],
                'Port': 8000,

        and application level health checks. A health check is considered to be
        application level if it associated with a service. A check is defined
        in a configuration file, or added at runtime over the HTTP interface.

        There are two different kinds of checks:

            - Script + Interval: These checks depend on invoking an external
                                 application which does the health check and
                                 exits with an appropriate exit code,
                                 potentially generating some output. A script
                                 is paired with an invocation interval
                                 (e.g. every 30 seconds). This is similar to
                                 the Nagios plugin system.

            - TTL: These checks retain their last known state for a given TTL.
                   The state of the check must be updated periodically
                   over the HTTP interface. If an external system fails to
                   update the status within a given TTL, the check is set to
                   the failed state. This mechanism is used to allow an
                   application to directly report it's health. For example,
                   a web app can periodically curl the endpoint, and if the
                   app fails, then the TTL will expire and the health check
                   enters a critical state. This is conceptually similar to a
                   dead man's switch.

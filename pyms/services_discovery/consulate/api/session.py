        None of the fields are mandatory, and in fact no body needs to be PUT
        if the defaults are to be used.

        Name can be used to provide a human-readable name for the Session.

        Behavior can be set to either ``release`` or ``delete``. This controls
        the behavior when a session is invalidated. By default, this is
        release, causing any locks that are held to be released. Changing this
        to delete causes any locks that are held to be deleted. delete is
        useful for creating ephemeral key/value entries.

        Node must refer to a node that is already registered, if specified.
        By default, the agent's own node name is used.

        LockDelay (``delay``) can be specified as a duration string using a
        "s" suffix for seconds. The default is 15s.

        The TTL field is a duration string, and like LockDelay it can use "s"
        as a suffix for seconds. If specified, it must be between 10s and
        3600s currently. When provided, the session is invalidated if it is
        not renewed before the TTL expires. See the session internals page
        for more documentation of this feature.

        Checks is used to provide a list of associated health checks. It is
        highly recommended that, if you override this list, you include the
        default "serfHealth".
